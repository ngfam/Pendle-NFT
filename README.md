## Pendle NFT

The NFT campaign is going to be launched with two type of boxes A and B. The expression for box A is expressionA and for B is expressionB, implemented in `expression.js`. 

Both of the expressions take gqlResp (the response of query from subgraph) as their only parameter. The corresponding graphql query for these two boxes are placed on top of each function itself. 

Example usecase of this is implemented in the function main of `expression.js`.
